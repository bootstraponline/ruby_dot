#### Export Ruby class diagrams on draw.io

Currently ruby_dot is able to parse file names, modules, and classes.
A node is generated for each file which contains a description of the modules/classes.
These nodes can then be manipulated using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/)

#### Example

Here's an example diagram using the ruby_dot code base. 
Note that the positioning and linking are done manually.
The nodes are created automatically using ruby_dot.
